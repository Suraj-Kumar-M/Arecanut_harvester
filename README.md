# Arecanut_harvester
 The Areca Nut Harvester project aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of areca nut harvesting by introducing a versatile and user-friendly remote-controlled harvesting system. Areca nut farming is a significant agricultural practice in many regions, and the conventional harvesting methods are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This project addresses these challenges by implementing a remote-controlled harvesting mechanism that not only reduces manual labor but also increases the overall productivity of the harvesting process.The system comprises a customized harvester equipped with robotic arms, rotating saw and a remote control interface. The robotic arms are designed to delicately cut areca nuts from the palm trees without causing damage to the trees or the produce. The remote control interface allows the operator to maneuver the harvester with precision, ensuring optimal harvesting efficiency. This Innovative agricultural device offers a modern alternative to traditional manual harvesting methods.
